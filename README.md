Milestone Tittle : Calculator functionally and interface

Description : 
                Create a new version of calcualtor who can arithmatic operation (addition  , subtraction , multiplication and division )and many type calculation. its interface will be user friendly that user not have facce any problem to do this . Also adding function thing that is error handling that is  division by zero . 
Testing and basic functionally are also part part of this milestones.


Significance : 
                This milestone is establish the core purpose of calculato project . well performing and giving correct answer when i calcualte any operation . this is not giving any error because it check all posible error when it was testing . i  will add in this projection advance functional things which you can do any calculation. YOu will see in this calculator all possible mathematical sign (e.g. alpha , beeta , gaama , theeta etc) this will be easy to calculation when you solving the questions.
