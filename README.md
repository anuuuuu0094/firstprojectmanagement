The Project was calcular .

Milestone Tittle : Calculator functionally and interface

Description :

Create a new version of calcualtor who can arithmatic operation (addition , subtraction , multiplication and division )and many type calculation. its interface will be user friendly that user not have facce any problem to do this . Also adding function thing that is error handling that is division by zero .
Testing and basic functionally are also part part of this milestones.



Significance :

This milestone is establish the core purpose of calculato project . well performing and giving correct answer when i calcualte any operation . this is not giving any error because it check all posible error when it was testing . i will add in this projection advance functional things which you can do any calculation. YOu will see in this calculator all possible mathematical sign (e.g. alpha , beeta , gaama , theeta etc) this will be easy to calculation when you solving the questions.

Reflection on Project Management Tools :-

                                        I am writing short reflection on project managemment by github . it is very impressive any well organised by ths team leader . In this many skilled programmer can join this and make your branch for the new implementation . You can create issue if you any issue find then you can reate easily on going to the create issue button . You can also set milestones for that issue which is more flexible to complete the issue timely . However, some challenges may arise when implementing these tools. Teams new to GitHub may face a learning curve, especially in effectively using labels, filters, and automation. Maintaining the board’s accuracy requires discipline—team members must consistently update issue statuses. Overloading the board with too many granular tasks can also become overwhelming, leading to confusion instead of clarity. in this github you can create a board there you can manage your project easily, how to do this project and how much doing continuous and how muh completed .
